SUMMARY = "SELinux Aos policy based on targeted policy"
DESCRIPTION = "\
This is the Aos modification for targeted variant of the \
SELinux reference policy. Most service domains are locked \
down. Users and admins will login in with unconfined_t \
domain, so they have the same access to the system as if \
SELinux was not enabled. \
